\title{
The Robust Accurate, Direct ICA aLgorithm (RADICAL).
}
\description{
An ICA algorithm based on an efficient entropy estimator (due to Vasicek) which
is robust to outliers.
}
\usage{
radical(X, n.comp = dim(X)[2], demean = TRUE, pca.cov = c("ML", "LW", "ROB", "EWMA"),
k = 150, augment = FALSE, replications = 30, sd = 0.175, firstEig = 1,
lastEig = dim(X)[1], pcaE = NULL, pcaD = NULL, whiteSig = NULL, whiteMat = NULL,
dewhiteMat = NULL, rseed = NULL, trace = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{ The multidimensional signal matrix, where each column of matrix represents
one observed signal.}
\item{n.comp}{ Number of independent components to estimate, defaults to the
dimension of the data (rows). Is overwritten by \code{firstEig} and \code{lastEig}.}
\item{demean}{ (Logical) Whether the data should be centered.}
\item{pca.cov}{
The method to use for the calculation of the covariance matrix during the
PCA whitening phase. \dQuote{ML} is the standard maximum likelihood method,
\dQuote{LW} is the Ledoit-Wolf method, \dQuote{ROB} is the robust method from
\pkg{MASS} package and \dQuote{EWMA} an exponentially weighted moving average
estimator. Optional parameters passed via the \dots argument.
}
\item{k}{ The number of angles at which to evaluate the contrast function. The
ICA contrast function will be evaluated at K evenly spaced rotations from
\eqn{-\pi/4} to \eqn{\pi/4}.
}
\item{augment}{ Whether to augment the data (as explained in paper). For large
datasets of >10,000 points this should be set to FALSE.}
\item{replications}{ This is the number of replicated points for each original
point. The default value is 30. The larger the number of points in the data set,
the smaller this value can be. For data sets of 10,000 points or more, point
replication should be de-activated by setting augment to FALSE.}
\item{sd}{This is the standard deviation (noise) of the replicated points when
using the augmentation option.}
\item{firstEig}{ This and \code{lastEig} specify the range for eigenvalues
that are retained, \code{firstEig} is the index of largest eigenvalue to be
retained. Making use of this option overwrites \code{n.comp}.
}
\item{lastEig}{ This is the index of the last (smallest) eigenvalue to be
retained and overwrites \code{n.comp} argument.}
\item{pcaE}{ Optionally provided eigenvector (must also supply \code{pcaD}).}
\item{pcaD}{ Optionally provided eigenvalues (must also supply \code{pcaE}).}
\item{whiteSig}{Optionally provided Whitened signal.}
\item{whiteMat}{ Optionally provided Whitening matrix (no.factors by no.signals).}
\item{dewhiteMat}{Optionally provided dewhitening matrix (no.signals by no.factors).}
\item{rseed}{Optionally provided seed to initialize the augmented data matrix.}
\item{trace}{To report progress in the console, set this to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{\dots}{Optional arguments passed to the pca.cov methods.}
}
\details{
The interested reader should consult the paper in the references section for
details on the properties of the algorithm.\cr
The algorithm is quite slow, despite partial implementation in C++, and should
only be used on small to medium sized sets.
}
\value{
A list containing the following values:
\item{A}{Estimated Mixing Matrix (no.signals by no.factors).}

\item{S}{The column vectors of estimated independent components (no.obs by no.factors).}
\item{C}{Estimated Covariance Matrix (no.signals by no.signals).}
\item{whiteningMatrix}{The Whitening matrix (no.factors by no.signals).}
\item{dewhiteningMatrix}{The de-Whitening matrix  (no.signals by no.factors).}
\item{rseed}{The random seed used (if any) for initializing the mixing matrix A.}
\item{elapsed}{The elapsed time.}
