	that (under the assumption that there is no upper limit on the investment
	in an asset) the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio
	is at most 2T + 2, where T is the number of time periods in the data
	base used to approximate the parameters of the return distributions
	of the assets. The formulation we present, which is shown to be equivalent
	to that of Konno and Yamazaki, has a bound of T + 2 on the number
	of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio.},

	takes advantage of models of covariance to simplify the equations
	that determine optimality. Fast algorithms exist for widely applied
	factor and scenario analysis for long-only portfolios. To allow their
	use in factor and scenario analysis for long-short portfolios, the
	concept of "trimability" is introduced. The conclusion is that the
	same fast algorithms that were designed for long-only portfolios
	can be used, virtually unchanged, for long-short portfolio optimization--provided
	the portfolio is trimable, which usually holds in practice.},
