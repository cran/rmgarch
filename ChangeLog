	breaking backward compatibility. Switched to zoo.
	* Added extra option in rcov and rcor ('output') to enable either an array (default)
	or a wide matrix/xts (when possible) for correlations and covariances. In the case
	of covariances, the diagonal is also returned, whilst for correlation only the lower
	diagonal.
	* Added STRICT_R_HEADERS per Dirk's email (change related to PI only).

	* Added option to use cluster on the window dimension rather than assets
	in dccroll.
	* Numerous minor changes to underlying functionality.

2016-09-20 Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.3-2.
  * gogarchsim now takes either a goGARCHfit or goGARCHfilter object. First argument
  to gogarchsim (fit) replaced by 'object'. This allows better handling of the simulated
  forecast density by first filtering for new data from a filtered object
  and then simulating the n-ahead density.

2016-02-20 Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.3-1.

2014-01-05 Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-4.
	* Implemented very fast flattened tensor indexing for
	the gogarch higher co-moment matrices using analytic
	relationship for coordinates of pairs {i=j,k=l}, leading
	to a 10x speed increase.

	the klin functionality for kronecker multiplication of
	the very large co-moment matrices.
	* Fix to DCC estimation method for case of different univariate
	specifications (reported by Suzanna Linn).

	* Enanced DCC based models to accept the newly released realGARCH model
	from rugarch (additional argument realizedVol required).

2013-09-02 Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-3.
	* replaced estimation of Kendall's tau with cor.fk function of pcaPP
	package which is very fast (affects static mvt copula).
	* Added some pro-active garbage collection in the simulation code since
	memory usage was building up without being released (fragmentation). Also
	replaced lapply with normal loop for better memory management.
	* Fix to cgarchspec and dccspec in the presence of external regressors (had
	previously saved the wrong dimension).

2013-05-26 Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-2.
	* Fix to cgarchsim in presence of variance targeting in the univariate
	models (exited with failure code).

	* Fixed problem in dccroll and gogarchroll not saving the correct
	forecast length in the output object.
	* Fix to gogarch extractor methods when using PCA dimensionality reduction
	prior to ICA (estimation ok, failed on use of rcor, rcov and related methods).
	* Some more functions in gogarch ported to Rcpp for speed and memory management
	(related to large dimensional tensors and kronecker product).

2013-04-10  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-0.
	* Version bump and update for use with rugarch 1.2-2 and R 3.0.0
	* Some fixes to methods rcoskew and rcokurt for goGARCHroll class
	(standardize option was not being passed and defaulted to TRUE). In any case
	method failed (with error) because of code bug.
	* Some fixes to DCC rolling plots and calcultion of moving window size
	(consistent with changes in rugarch).
	* Updated rmgarch.tests.

2013-02-20  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.00-4.

2013-02-09  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.00-3.
	* fscenario and fmoments re-worked. Now have fitted, rcov, rcoskew and
	rcokurt methods for extracting the scenario and moments.
	* Some fixes to rocokurt and rcoskew with switch roll="all".
	* Updated examples in rmgarch.tests folder.

2013-02-02  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.00-2.
	* As in the rugarch package, xts now exclusively used. The extract methods
	sigma, fitted and residuals return an xts object, whilst the extractors
	rcov and rcor (which return arrays) have an attribute called 'index' which
	contains the time index in order to re-construct a 2-dimensional xts object
	(useful for printing pairwise correlations). The rolling forecast method has
	also been re-written to return simpler xts objects (sigma and fitted) and
	more informative arrays for the covariance and correlation. The optional
	argument roll for denoting which rolling estimation window to return results
	is now deprecated as all the rolling forecasts are returned in a much
	simplified container. All 3 models (GOGARCH, CGARCH and DCC) now have a
	uniform set of extractors and return a uniform type of value.
	* Change to the DCC plot functions to conform to new xts output.
	* Changes to the copula code to reflect the vectorization of distribution
	functions in rugarch (which return vectors rather than matrices when a matrix
	is input into the first argument).
	* GO-GARCH extractors including rcov, rcor, rcoskew and rcokurt moved to C++
	leading to very large speedup (as a result of the affine
	transformation/matrix multiplications).
	* Many CGARCH and DCC extractor and utility functions (e.g.'sigma' as
	diag(time varying cov)) moved to C++ (RcppArmadillo) for more than 10x
	speed increase.

2012-12-25  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.00.
	* Changes to comply with new rugarch package, particularly with regards
	to parallel functionality (exclusive use of parallel package), and enhancements
	to rolling estimation and forecast.
	* Streamline of gogarch methods and some bug fixes.
	* Added FDCC model (v. 1.00-1) and rmgarch.test5 examples.
	* Started on ICA to C++ translation.

	* Small bug fix to nisurface in GO-GARCH model arising from high precision.

2012-09-31  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.96.
	* varxfit parallel functionality implemented for expensive robust calculation
	method.
	* Substantial Re-Write of ICA functionality and export of ICA functions
	(africa package on r-forge will not be released to CRAN and eventually
	removed). Only locally implemented versions of fastica and radical are now
	allowed (removed PearsonICA and JADE).
	* Part of RADICAL code ported to C++ for speed.
	* Added different covariance estimators for the ICA whitening routines.
	* GO-GARCH model now allows to pass n.comp to ICA routine for dimensionality
	reduction during the PCA whitening phase (via the ... argument in gogarchfit).
	Experimental at present until some theoretical issues are resolved.
	* Re-write of gogarch methods and functions.
	* Some corrections to gogarchsim.
	* Removed some dependencies no longer needed.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.95.
	* Export and fix of wmargin function.
	* Changes to gogarchsim to include ability to do rolling simulation
	based forecast (added example rmgarch.test1j in rmgarch.tests folder).
	* Some fixes to gogarch under certain lag combinations.
	* Numerous bug fixes to dccsim and cgarchsim function (now correctly
	generates conditional correlated random deviates for the multivariate
	laplace and student distributions - new C++ functions). Added small
	test rmgarch.test2h in rmgarch.tests folder).
	* New function DCCtest. Implements the test of non-constant correlation of
	Engle and Sheppard (2001) using a static GARCH Copula (Normal).
	* Reduced verbosity in estimation (mostly related to VAR).

2012-03-16  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	with small example of weighted kurtosis).
	* 100x efficiency increase in intermediate storage requirement for
	cokurtosis calculation by using klin.eval from klin package in kronecker
	product for gogarch model.
	* GARCH Scaling in DCC turned off by default.

2011-12-06  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.92.
	* Some fixes to build and load on newer version of R.

2011-10-09  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>

	goGARCHfilter classes.

2011-09-20  Alexios Galanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.9.
	* Multivariate GARCH models split from rgarch package into rmgarch.
	* Substantial re-write of multivariate code.
	* Still more testing remaining and vignette will not be written until
	late 2011, at which point it will be released to CRAN (the complexity and
	new method definitions for the GOGARCH model with multivariate affine NIG
	and GH distributions will likely make it difficult for people to use without
	a vignette).
